# Customer-Churn-Prediction-Project
Predicting customer churn using machine learning to help businesses improve retention strategies.

This repository contains a machine learning project focused on predicting customer churn for businesses. The project demonstrates the end-to-end workflow of a churn prediction model, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model building, evaluation, and visualization.

Key Features:

Data cleaning and preprocessing to handle missing values, categorical variables, and imbalanced datasets.

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and trends in customer behavior.

Implementation of Logistic Regression machine learning model for churn prediction.

Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Insights to help businesses reduce customer churn and improve retention strategies.

Technologies Used:

Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn

Jupyter Notebook for interactive analysis

Pickle for saving trained models

Use Case:
Ideal for business analysts, data scientists, and students looking to understand customer behavior and improve retention strategies through predictive modeling.
